2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net next_max_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin next_max_reg_i_2/O, cell next_max_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net op3/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin op3/next_BCD1_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell op3/next_BCD1_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net op3/pb_out_reg_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin op3/next_BCD3_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell op3/next_BCD3_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clkDivBy27/num_reg[26]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clkDivBy27/counter[3]_i_3/O, cell clkDivBy27/counter[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
